# I'm Leo

As a computer science student at Uppsala University ðŸ“šðŸ’», I am dedicated to enhancing my skills and broadening my understanding of the field. I am particularly captivated by the potential of technology to help us understand and improve the world around us. I am actively engaged in learning and experimenting with various programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS and JS.

Apart from my enthusiasm for technology, I am also deeply passionate about science ðŸ”¬, and I believe in the power of skepticism and inquiry ðŸ¤”. I believe that by challenging assumptions and remaining open to new ideas, we can make meaningful progress and find solutions to some of the most pressing problems of our time.
