🌊 Welcome to My Github Profile! 

Hello, I'm Leo. I'm a computer science student at Uppsala University, where I am constantly striving to sharpen my abilities and expand my knowledge of the field. I am particularly fascinated by the way technology can be utilized to understand and enhance the world around us. I am actively engaged in learning and experimenting with various programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.
