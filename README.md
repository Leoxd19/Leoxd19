Welcome to My Github Profile! 🌟

Hello, I'm Leo. I'm a computer science student at Uppsala University, where I am constantly striving to sharpen my abilities and expand my knowledge in the field. I am particularly fascinated by the way technology can be utilized to understand and enhance the world around us. I am actively engaged in learning and experimenting with various programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.

In addition to my passion for technology, I am also deeply interested in science 🔬 and believe in the importance of skepticism and inquiry 🤔. I believe that by challenging assumptions and remaining open to new ideas, we can make meaningful progress and find solutions to some of the most pressing problems of our time.
